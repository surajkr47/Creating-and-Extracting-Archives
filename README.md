# Creating-and-Extracting-Archives
This project focuses on the practical application of command-line tools for archiving and compressing files.  Participants will learn to create tarballs, compress them using gzip, and efficiently extract files from these  archives. This process is essential for effective data management, particularly in backup solutions and data  transfer.
